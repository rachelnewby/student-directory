# Student Directory 

This repo is part of the Makers Academy Bootcamp which taught the basics of building a command line appliation. <br>

## The Task

Create a Ruby script that manages a directory of the students attending 'Villains Academy'. 

The script will be invoked from the command line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have a text-based interface.

## How to use

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
